### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupam715code/Loan-App.git

cd Loan-App
```

### Step 2: Configure Database
1. Create a database in **phpMyAdmin** (e.g., `loan_management`).
2. Import `database/loan_management.sql` into your MySQL database.
3. Configure database settings in `application/config/database.php`:
```php
$db['default'] = array(
    'dsn'   => '',
    'hostname' => 'localhost',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'database' => 'loan_management',
    'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
);
```

### Step 3: Enable `.htaccess` (Remove `index.php` from URLs)
1. Rename `htaccess` file to `.htaccess`.
2. Update `application/config/config.php`:
```php
$config['index_page'] = '';
```
